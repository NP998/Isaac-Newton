              <h3 >Newton, Sir Isaac (1642-1727), mathematician and physicist, one of the foremost scientific intellects
                   of all time. Born at Woolsthorpe, near Grantham in Lincolnshire, where he attended school, he entered
                    Cambridge University in 1661; he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1667, and Lucasian 
                    Professor of Mathematics in 1669. He remained at the university, lecturing in most years, until 1696.
                     Of these Cambridge years, in which Newton was at the height of his creative power, he singled out
                      1665-1666 (spent largely in Lincolnshire because of plague in Cambridge) as "the prime of my age
                       for invention". During two to three years of intense mental effort he prepared Philosophiae 
                       Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) commonly known as
                        the Principia, although this was not published until 1687.
              </h3>
              <h3 class="my-3">As a firm opponent of the attempt by King James II to make the universities into Catholic institutions,
                   Newton was elected Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge to the Convention Parliament of 1689,
                    and sat again in 1701-1702. Meanwhile, in 1696 he had moved to London as Warden of the Royal Mint. He became
                     Master of the Mint in 1699, an office he retained to his death. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
                      of London in 1671, and in 1703 he became President, being annually re-elected for the rest of his life.
                       His major work, Opticks, appeared the next year; he was knighted in Cambridge in 1705.
               </h3>
               <h3 class="my-3">As Newtonian science became increasingly accepted on the Continent, and especially after a general peace was restored in 1714, 
                     following the War of the Spanish Succession, Newton became the most highly esteemed natural philosopher in Europe.
                      His last decades were passed in revising his major works, polishing his studies of ancient history, and defending
                      
                       himself against critics, as well as carrying out his official duties. Newton was modest, diffident, and a man of
                        simple tastes. He was angered by criticism or opposition, and harboured resentment; he was harsh towards enemies
                         but generous to friends. In government, and at the Royal Society, he proved an able administrator. He never 
                         married and lived modestly, but was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey.

              <h3>In 1664, while still a student, Newton read recent work on optics and light by the English physicists 
                  Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke; he also studied both the mathematics and the physics of the French 
                  philosopher and scientist René Descartes. He investigated the refraction of light by a glass prism;
                   developing over a few years a series of increasingly elaborate, refined, and exact experiments, 
                   Newton discovered measurable, mathematical patterns in the phenomenon of colour. He found white 
                   light to be a mixture of infinitely varied coloured rays (manifest in the rainbow and the spectrum),
                    each ray definable by the angle through which it is refracted on entering or leaving a given 
                    transparent medium. He correlated this notion with his study of the interference colours of thin
                     films (for example, of oil on water, or soap bubbles), using a simple technique of extreme acuity
                      to measure the thickness of such films. He held that light consisted of streams of minute particles.
                       From his experiments he could infer the magnitudes of the transparent "corpuscles" forming the 
                       surfaces of bodies, which, according to their dimensions, so interacted with white light as to reflect,
                        selectively, the different observed colours of those surfaces.

              <h3>
                  The roots of these unconventional ideas were with Newton by about 1668; when first expressed (tersely and partially)
                   in public in 1672 and 1675, they provoked hostile criticism, mainly because colours were thought to be modified 
                   forms of homogeneous white light. Doubts, and Newton's rejoinders, were printed in the learned journals. Notably, 
                   the scepticism of Christiaan Huygens and the failure of the French physicist Edmé Mariotte to duplicate Newton's
                    refraction experiments in 1681 set scientists on the Continent against him for a generation. The publication of 
                    Opticks, largely written by 1692, was delayed by Newton until the critics were dead. The book was still imperfect:
                     the colours of diffraction defeated Newton. Nevertheless, Opticks established itself, from about 1715, as a model
                      of the interweaving of theory with quantitative experimentation.

              <h3>In mathematics too, early brilliance appeared in Newton's student notes. He may have learnt geometry at school,
                   though he always spoke of himself as self-taught; certainly he advanced through studying the writings of his
                    compatriots William Oughtred and John Wallis, and of Descartes and the Dutch school. Newton made contributions
                     to all branches of mathematics then studied, but is especially famous for his solutions to the contemporary 
                      problems in analytical geometry of drawing tangents to curves (differentiation) and defining areas bounded by curves (integration).
                   Not only did Newton discover that these problems were inverse to each other, but he discovered general methods of
                    resolving problems of curvature, embraced in his "method of fluxions" and "inverse method of fluxions", respectively
                    quivalent to Leibniz's later differential and integral calculus. Newton used the term "fluxion" 
                    (from Latin meaning "flow") because he imagined a quantity "flowing" from one magnitude to another. 
                    Fluxions were expressed algebraically, as Leibniz's differentials were, but Newton made extensive use also
                     (especially in the Principia) of analogous geometrical arguments. Late in life, Newton expressed regret for
                      the algebraic style of recent mathematical progress, preferring the geometrical method of the Classical Greeks,
                       which he regarded as clearer and more rigorous.

            <h3>According to the well-known story, it was on seeing an apple fall in his orchard at some time during 1665
                 or 1666 that Newton conceived that the same force governed the motion of the Moon and the apple. 
                 He calculated the force needed to hold the Moon in its orbit, as compared with the force pulling an object
                  to the ground. He also calculated the centripetal force needed to hold a stone in a sling, and the relation 
                  between the length of a pendulum and the time of its swing. These early explorations were not soon exploited
                   by Newton, though he studied astronomy and the problems of planetary motion.

                   its basis and it survived into the late 19th century before it began to show signs of failing.
